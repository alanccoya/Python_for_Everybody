# Python Project - Salary and Temperature Calculator

This Python project includes two simple programs:
1. A **Salary Calculator** that asks the user for the number of hours worked and the hourly rate, then calculates and displays the gross salary.
2. A **Temperature Converter** that converts a given temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit.

## Features
- User input is handled using Python's `input()` function.
- Calculations are performed using basic arithmetic operations.
- The output is formatted for clarity, including two decimal places in the temperature conversion.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or later is required to run the scripts.
- This project uses f-strings for string formatting, so a recent Python version is recommended.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the script files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the scripts are saved.
3. Run the scripts using Python:
   - For the salary calculator:
     ```bash
     python salary.py
     ```
   - For the temperature converter:
     ```bash
     python temperature.py
     ```
